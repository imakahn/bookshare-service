Backend Engineer System Design

Instructions:

This system design challenge is meant to get an idea of how much knowledge you have working with backend systems. Please try to be as thorough and descriptive as possible. It is simply an architecture design question and you are not meant to write much functional code except for a few database queries and those queries are not being checked for syntactical errors nor are they being tested against an actual database. Charts, diagrams, and other visual aids are a huge plus. This assignment should take about an hour to two hours max.

Product: Peer to peer Book Store.

Imagine there is a book store where people can take their books that they’ve already bought and read and instead of it collecting dust on their shelves, they can put this book up for rent online using this crowdfunded book store app. Everytime this book is rented, the person who put the book up for rent is going to get a portion of the rent price thus making a profit on their used book. Customers may also buy it out right if they choose at a specified price. All of this happens through an online portal of some sort where users can see the catalog of books and reserve them. Book owners have the ability to go in and take their books off the “shelves”, change or edit the price, and add more books.

What would a backend system look like for this book store? What kind of a tech stack would one use to build this and why? Provide an ERD.

Say for instance I really admire a given user’s taste in books and I would like to see all the books that they have for rent. How would I query this?

What if I want to see all the previous owners/renters of a given book, how would I accomplish this? What needs to change with the current architecture to accomplish this?
